Consider a C program that contains the following declarations:

int i, j;
long ix;
short s;
float x;
double dx;
char c;
unsigned long ux;

Determine the data type of each of the following expressions:

a) i + c; ==> int
b) x + c; ==> float
c) dx + x; ==> double
d) ((int) dx) + ix; ==> long
e) i + x; ==> float
f) s + j; ==> int
g) ix + j; ==> long
h) s + c; ==> short
i) ix + c; ==> long
j) ix + ux; ==> unsigned long
